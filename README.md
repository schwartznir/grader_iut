# grader_iut

A simple code grading students' code submissions in the course M398 given at Institut universitaire technologique d'Orsay in 2020-2021. The maximal grade is 20: 5 points are given for using a correct coding style (tested by `pylint` with the custom `.pylintrc`) and 15 for passing numerical tests (the examples from 2020-2021 appear in the file 'tests.py`). The results are stored in a pandas DataFrame exported to a csv file in the end.
